FAQ-1: If there is a drift in between terraform and Device for the same resource block, then
To check the difference, "$ terraform plan -refresh-only"
To change keeping terraform state and change the device as per terraform '$ terraform apply -auto-approve"
To change in terraform and keep device config as it is, "$ terraform apply refresh-only -auto-approve"
